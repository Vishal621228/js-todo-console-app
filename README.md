# JavaScript Console To-Do List App
This is my first JavaScript mini-project, completely based on the back-end logic of a to-do list
This is a **console-based To-Do List application** built using pure JavaScript. I created this project to **test my logic-building skills** and **strengthen my fundamentals** in JavaScript


## Features

-  Add new tasks
- List all current tasks
-  Delete specific tasks with input validation
-  Graceful exit with `"quit"` or cancel
-  Handles null inputs and empty list scenarios


##  Why I Built This

I wanted to:
- Test my growing **logical thinking**
- Practice core JS syntax like loops, conditionals, arrays, and input handling
- Build a complete app **on my own**, without relying on tutorials or AI help
- Have fun applying my DSA skills in a real-world mini project


## ðŸš€ How to Run the App

1. Open your browser (Chrome recommended).
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools â†’ Go to the **Console** tab.
3. Paste the full JavaScript code.
4. Interact using the following commands:
    - `"add"` â†’ Add a new task
    - `"list"` â†’ View all tasks
    - `"delete"` â†’ Delete a specific task
    - `"quit"` or Cancel prompt â†’ Exit the app
